## Twitter Clone

## Setup app: 
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
flask run

## Overview: 
Python, Flask, WTForms, SQLAlchemy app that mimics twitter. Added functionalities to be able to like/unlike messages, view follower bios, 
and allow users to logout.

## Notes:
This app was partially built as part of the bootcamp curriculum and I utilized the code solution in various parts of the app which 
are mostly highlighted in comments, and depended quite heavily on solution for the tests
